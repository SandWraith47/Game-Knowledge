        <h3>so when we get into the world of far cry or also know as Leboa-sako . In the frist 5 min of real time in
            game
            you will feel very bored
            but just for 5min and after that nothing special after you woke up after survicing maralia and heavy open
            fire
            you will meet some officers
            and just 10 min after some warm up in game you can do as you wish
            . You will meet some buddies like Quabar,Joeshap and many as you go htrough the story.

        <h1>Main problem:-</h1>
        <li>Too many enemy to go through by and not powerful and annoying</li>
        <li>Long distance travel even if you use bus.You have to use external use of transport</li>
        <li>Save game is a prob becasue it is not auto-save so if you do some mission big enough to die 2-3 time and you
            forgot to save it and you die on very small
            thing the game will throw you back at your last save and you have to that mission again
            and you can rage quit it but patience is the key of success and just don'throw you computer.</li>
